# Specification Mining
This repository reflects the ongoing development of the specification mining algorithm we are working on. The necessity of specification in the verification of electronic domain is well acknowledged by the concerned community. Specification is the first step of digital design. Lack of proper specification has lead us many catastrophies throughout the history. There has been many endavors to determine correct specifications for any system but none of them obliterated the need for further work in this domain. Besides, the more researches going on this field, we are getting more insights that are conducive to deduce a reliable set of specifications. Current trend in specification mining has more focused on the application of Machine Learning Algorithms in this domain. Many researchers these days are working on the existing ML algorithms to become fit for determinig efficiant and reliable set of specifications for reactive systems.  

## Specification Mining for SoC validation
Currently we are focused on developing a mining algorithm which will provide specifications in more general ways for any SoC validation based on the trace data set. We stick to the traditional approachs of sequential rule mining with enhanced scalability. Prevalent algorithms fails to reduce search space which grows exponentially as the length of the rule increases. Besides mining a large set of rules is often redundant and can not be helpful in many cases. So we are currently working on the pruning of search space and generate a satisfactory number of rules which full of soundness and higher accuracy.
